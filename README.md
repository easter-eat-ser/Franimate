# Franimate
Software for creating small, low-framerate animations with a static background
## Setup
Simply run the program with an IDE or the latest Python 3, no requirements other than Tkinter, `json`, and `math` (which should be preinstalled with Python).
If the library Tkinter is missing, try these commands:
### Ubuntu/Debian
`sudo apt-get install python3-tk `
### Windows
Reinstall Python3 from the executable installer, but make sure to check the box that installs Tk
### MacOS
`brew install python-tk`
## Other fixes
For lag when using drawing tablets, switch off Windows Ink in your tablet's settings
